                        Today we'll spend the class working on our
                        creative resumes. We'll also do a small crash
                        course of career dev that acts as a refresher
                        for some concepts you've already learned.

                            exercise.

                            After a short break, we'll work on our
                            Creative Resume (Final) for the rest of class.
